<h3 class="h1">Animations</h3>
<p>
  Things that move!
  My animation experience starts with fun little CSS animations,
  and moves on to <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code> animations,
  then hopefully on to a full-fledged animation complete with sound!
  Assuming I can find a proper alternative after Flash is dead... ðŸ˜‰
