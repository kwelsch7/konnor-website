<h3 class="h1">Animations</h3>

  Things that move!
  My animation experience starts with fun little CSS animations
  and a couple JavaScript animations. Someday when I can commit
  to making regular donations to Adobe for Adobe Animate, I
  will be able to make some cartoons...
  But here is this for now. 😁
